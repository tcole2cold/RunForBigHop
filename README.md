#What is this?
Run For Big Hop is a simple site that uses Strava activity data to calculate how many Big Hop beers worth of calories your latest exercise burned. 
I made this mostly for fun, but partially because I had never handled the whole OAuth process for an API like this by myself before. It’s basic stuff, but I’m a hands-on learner and just wanted to sort through the entire process by myself. 

#What is Big Hop?
It’s the flagship beer made by Pittsburgh’s East End Brewing Company. It’s an American Pale Ale. Really good stuff! I’m obviously a fan. 

#What tech is used here?
This is a simple HTML + CSS + JS project. No fancy frameworks here. 
I built in the back-end authentication to a different side project server I already had running. So there is a little bit of Java (Spring MVC) handling the token pass-off. 

#Can I do anything with this code / contribute to this project? 
Sure! I have annotated the JavaScript file with comments on how stuff works. If you’re also a runner, drinker and someone who wants to work through the basics of OAuth (lol), I think this would be a pretty fun project to replicate with your own favorite beer. 
As for contributions, put in a pull request! I’m 100% sure you can fix/improve this thing. I plan on upgrading the secondary screen in the future to show more than just the latest activity. There’s a lot more that can be done, too! Maybe add more beer options? 

#Thanks . . . 
. . . for having a look at this! Hope the project made you laugh a little.
